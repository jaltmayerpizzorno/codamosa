If the numeric components of two version\n    numbers are equal, then one with a pre-release tag will always\n    be deemed earlier (lesser) than one without.\n\n    The following are valid version numbers (shown in the order that\n    would be obtained by sorting according to the supplied cmp function):\n\n        0.4       0.4.0  (these two are equivalent)\n        0.4.1\n        0.5a1\n        0.5b3\n        0.5\n        0.9.6\n        1.0\n        1.0.4a3\n        1.0.4b1\n        1.0.4\n\n    The following are examples of invalid version numbers:\n\n        1\n        2.7.2.2\n        1.3.a4\n        1.3pl1\n        1.3c4\n\n    The rationale for this version numbering system will be explained\n    in the distutils documentation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    version_re = re.compile(r'^(\\d+) \\.

If only periods, then these are compared\n#    left-to-right to determine an ordering.\n# 2) sequences of letters are part of the tuple for comparison and are\n#    compared lexicographically\n# 3) recognize the numeric components may have leading zeroes\n#\n# The LooseVersion class below implements these rules: a version number\n# string is split up into a tuple of integer and string components, and\n# comparison is a simple tuple comparison.  This means that version\n# numbers behave in a predictable and obvious way, but a way that might\n# not necessarily be how people *want* version numbers to behave.  There\n# wouldn't be a problem if people could stick to purely numeric version\n# numbers: just split on period and compare the numbers as tuples.\n# However, people insist on putting letters into their version numbers;\n# the most common purpose seems to be:\n#   - indicating a \"pre-release\" version\n#     ('alpha', 'beta', 'a', 'b', 'pre', 'p')\n#   - indicating a post-release patch ('p', 'pl', 'patch')\n# but of course this can't cover all version number schemes, and there's\n# no way to know what a programmer means without asking him.\n#\n# The problem is what to do with letters (and other non-numeric\n# characters) in a version number.  The current implementation does the\n# obvious and predictable thing: keep them as strings and compare\n# lexically within a tuple comparison.  This has the desired effect if\n# an appended letter sequence implies something \"post-release\":\n# eg. \"0.99\" < \"0.99pl14\" < \"1.0\", and \"5.001\" < \"5.001m\" < \"5.002\".\n#\n# However, if letters in a version number imply a pre-release version,\n# the \"obvious\" thing isn't correct.  Eg. you would expect that\n# \"1.5.1\" < \"1.5.2a2\" < \"1.5.2\", but under the tuple/lexical comparison\n# implemented here, this just isn't so.\n#\n# Two possible solutions come to mind.  The first is to tie the\n# comparison algorithm to a particular set of semantic rules, as has\n# been done in the StrictVersion class above.  This works great as long\n# as everyone can go along with bondage and discipline.  Hopefully a\n# (large) subset of Python module programmers will agree that the\n# particular flavour of bondage and discipline provided by StrictVersion\n# provides enough benefit to be worth using, and will submit their\n# version numbering scheme to its domination.  The free-thinking\n# anarchists in the lot will never give in, though, and something needs\n# to be done to accommodate them.\n#\n# Perhaps a \"moderately strict\" version class could be implemented that\n# lets almost anything slide (syntactically), and makes some heuristic\n# assumptions about non-digits in version number strings.  This could\n# sink into special-case-hell, though; if I was as talented and\n# idiosyncratic as Larry Wall, I'd go ahead and implement a class that\n# somehow knows that \"1.2.1\" < \"1.2.2a2\" < \"1.2.2\" < \"1.2.2pl3\", and is\n# just as happy dealing with things like \"2g6\" and \"1.13++\".  I don't\n# think I'm smart enough to do it right though.\n#\n# In any case, I've coded the test suite for this module (see\n# ../test/test_version.py) specifically to fail on things like comparing\n# \"1.2a2\" and \"1.2\".  That's not because the *code* is doing anything\n# wrong, it's because the simple, obvious design doesn't match my\n# complicated, hairy expectations for real-world version numbers.  It\n# would be a snap to fix the test suite to say, \"Yep, LooseVersion does\n# the Right Thing\" (ie. the code matches the conception).  But I'd rather\n# have a conception that matches common notions about version numbers.\n\n\nclass LooseVersion(Version):\n    \"\"\"Version numbering for anarchists and software realists.\n    Implements the standard interface for version number classes as\n    described above.

A version number consists of two or three\n    dot-separated numeric components, with an optional \"pre-release\" tag\n    on the end.  The pre-release tag consists of the letter 'a' or 'b'\n    followed by a number.  If the numeric components of two version\n    numbers are equal, then one with a pre-release tag will always\n    be deemed earlier (lesser) than one without.\n\n    The following are valid version numbers (shown in the order that\n    would be obtained by sorting according to the supplied cmp function):\n\n        0.4       0.4.0  (these two are equivalent)\n        0.4.1\n        0.5a1\n        0.5b3\n        0.5\n        0.9.6\n        1.0\n        1.0.4a3\n        1.0.4b1\n        1.0.4\n\n    The following are examples of invalid version numbers:\n\n        1\n        2.7.2.2\n        1.3.a4\n        1.3pl1\n        1.3c4\n\n    The rationale for this version numbering system will be explained\n    in the distutils documentation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    version_re = re.compile(r'^(\\d+) \\.

If only periods, then these are compared\n#    left-to-right to determine an ordering.\n# 2) sequences of letters are part of the tuple for comparison and are\n#    compared lexicographically\n# 3) recognize the numeric components may have leading zeroes\n#\n# The LooseVersion class below implements these rules: a version number\n# string is split up into a tuple of integer and string components, and\n# comparison is a simple tuple comparison.  This means that version\n# numbers behave in a predictable and obvious way, but a way that might\n# not necessarily be how people *want* version numbers to behave.  There\n# wouldn't be a problem if people could stick to purely numeric version\n# numbers: just split on period and compare the numbers as tuples.\n# However, people insist on putting letters into their version numbers;\n# the most common purpose seems to be:\n#   - indicating a \"pre-release\" version\n#     ('alpha', 'beta', 'a', 'b', 'pre', 'p')\n#   - indicating a post-release patch ('p', 'pl', 'patch')\n# but of course this can't cover all version number schemes, and there's\n# no way to know what a programmer means without asking him.\n#\n# The problem is what to do with letters (and other non-numeric\n# characters) in a version number.  The current implementation does the\n# obvious and predictable thing: keep them as strings and compare\n# lexically within a tuple comparison.  This has the desired effect if\n# an appended letter sequence implies something \"post-release\":\n# eg. \"0.99\" < \"0.99pl14\" < \"1.0\", and \"5.001\" < \"5.001m\" < \"5.002\".\n#\n# However, if letters in a version number imply a pre-release version,\n# the \"obvious\" thing isn't correct.  Eg. you would expect that\n# \"1.5.1\" < \"1.5.2a2\" < \"1.5.2\", but under the tuple/lexical comparison\n# implemented here, this just isn't so.\n#\n# Two possible solutions come to mind.  The first is to tie the\n# comparison algorithm to a particular set of semantic rules, as has\n# been done in the StrictVersion class above.  This works great as long\n# as everyone can go along with bondage and discipline.  Hopefully a\n# (large) subset of Python module programmers will agree that the\n# particular flavour of bondage and discipline provided by StrictVersion\n# provides enough benefit to be worth using, and will submit their\n# version numbering scheme to its domination.  The free-thinking\n# anarchists in the lot will never give in, though, and something needs\n# to be done to accommodate them.\n#\n# Perhaps a \"moderately strict\" version class could be implemented that\n# lets almost anything slide (syntactically), and makes some heuristic\n# assumptions about non-digits in version number strings.  This could\n# sink into special-case-hell, though; if I was as talented and\n# idiosyncratic as Larry Wall, I'd go ahead and implement a class that\n# somehow knows that \"1.2.1\" < \"1.2.2a2\" < \"1.2.2\" < \"1.2.2pl3\", and is\n# just as happy dealing with things like \"2g6\" and \"1.13++\".  I don't\n# think I'm smart enough to do it right though.\n#\n# In any case, I've coded the test suite for this module (see\n# ../test/test_version.py) specifically to fail on things like comparing\n# \"1.2a2\" and \"1.2\".  That's not because the *code* is doing anything\n# wrong, it's because the simple, obvious design doesn't match my\n# complicated, hairy expectations for real-world version numbers.  It\n# would be a snap to fix the test suite to say, \"Yep, LooseVersion does\n# the Right Thing\" (ie. the code matches the conception).

If only periods, then these are compared\n#    left-to-right to determine an ordering.\n# 2) sequences of letters are part of the tuple for comparison and are\n#    compared lexicographically\n# 3) recognize the numeric components may have leading zeroes\n#\n# The LooseVersion class below implements these rules: a version number\n# string is split up into a tuple of integer and string components, and\n# comparison is a simple tuple comparison.  This means that version\n# numbers behave in a predictable and obvious way, but a way that might\n# not necessarily be how people *want* version numbers to behave.  There\n# wouldn't be a problem if people could stick to purely numeric version\n# numbers: just split on period and compare the numbers as tuples.\n# However, people insist on putting letters into their version numbers;\n# the most common purpose seems to be:\n#   - indicating a \"pre-release\" version\n#     ('alpha', 'beta', 'a', 'b', 'pre', 'p')\n#   - indicating a post-release patch ('p', 'pl', 'patch')\n# but of course this can't cover all version number schemes, and there's\n# no way to know what a programmer means without asking him.\n#\n# The problem is what to do with letters (and other non-numeric\n# characters) in a version number.  The current implementation does the\n# obvious and predictable thing: keep them as strings and compare\n# lexically within a tuple comparison.  This has the desired effect if\n# an appended letter sequence implies something \"post-release\":\n# eg. \"0.99\" < \"0.99pl14\" < \"1.0\", and \"5.001\" < \"5.001m\" < \"5.002\".\n#\n# However, if letters in a version number imply a pre-release version,\n# the \"obvious\" thing isn't correct.  Eg. you would expect that\n# \"1.5.1\" < \"1.5.2a2\" < \"1.5.2\", but under the tuple/lexical comparison\n# implemented here, this just isn't so.\n#\n# Two possible solutions come to mind.  The first is to tie the\n# comparison algorithm to a particular set of semantic rules, as has\n# been done in the StrictVersion class above.  This works great as long\n# as everyone can go along with bondage and discipline.  Hopefully a\n# (large) subset of Python module programmers will agree that the\n# particular flavour of bondage and discipline provided by StrictVersion\n# provides enough benefit to be worth using, and will submit their\n# version numbering scheme to its domination.  The free-thinking\n# anarchists in the lot will never give in, though, and something needs\n# to be done to accommodate them.\n#\n# Perhaps a \"moderately strict\" version class could be implemented that\n# lets almost anything slide (syntactically), and makes some heuristic\n# assumptions about non-digits in version number strings.  This could\n# sink into special-case-hell, though; if I was as talented and\n# idiosyncratic as Larry Wall, I'd go ahead and implement a class that\n# somehow knows that \"1.2.1\" < \"1.2.2a2\" < \"1.2.2\" < \"1.2.2pl3\", and is\n# just as happy dealing with things like \"2g6\" and \"1.13++\".  I don't\n# think I'm smart enough to do it right though.\n#\n# In any case, I've coded the test suite for this module (see\n# ../test/test_version.py) specifically to fail on things like comparing\n# \"1.2a2\" and \"1.2\".  That's not because the *code* is doing anything\n# wrong, it's because the simple, obvious design doesn't match my\n# complicated, hairy expectations for real-world version numbers.  It\n# would be a snap to fix the test suite to say, \"Yep, LooseVersion does\n# the Right Thing\" (ie. the code matches the conception).
