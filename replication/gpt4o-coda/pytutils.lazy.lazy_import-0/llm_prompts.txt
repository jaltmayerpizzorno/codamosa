Typically use looks like::\n\n    from bzrlib.lazy_import import lazy_import\n    lazy_import(globals(), '''\n    from bzrlib import (\n        errors,\n        osutils,\n        branch,\n        )\n    import bzrlib.branch\n    ''')\n\nThen 'errors, osutils, branch' and 'bzrlib' will exist as lazy-loaded\nobjects which will be replaced with a real object on first use.\n\nIn general, it is best to only load modules in this way. This is because\nit isn't safe to pass these variables to other functions before they\nhave been replaced. This is especially true for constants, sometimes\ntrue for classes or functions (when used as a factory, or you want\nto inherit from them).\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\n\n\nclass IllegalUseOfScopeReplacer(Exception):\n\n    _fmt = (\"ScopeReplacer object %(name)r was used incorrectly:\"\n            \" %(msg)s%(extra)s\")\n\n    def __init__(self, name, msg, extra=None):\n        self.name = name\n        self.msg = msg\n        if extra:\n            self.extra = ': ' + str(extra)\n        else:\n            self.extra = ''\n\n        super(IllegalUseOfScopeReplacer, self).__init__()\n\n    def _format(self):\n        s = getattr(self, '_preformatted_string', None)\n        if s is not None:\n            # contains a preformatted message\n            return s\n        try:\n            fmt = self._get_format_string()\n            if fmt:\n                d = dict(self.__dict__)\n                s = fmt % d\n                # __str__() should always return a 'str' object\n                # never a 'unicode' object.\n                return s\n        except Exception as e:\n            pass # just bind to 'e' for formatting below\n        else:\n            e = None\n        return 'Unprintable exception %s: dict=%r, fmt=%r, error=%r' \\\n            % (self.__class__.__name__,\n               self.__dict__,\n               getattr(self, '_fmt', None),\n               e)\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        u = self._format()\n        if isinstance(u, str):\n            # Try decoding the str using the default encoding.\n            u = unicode(u)\n        elif not isinstance(u, unicode):\n            # Try to make a unicode object from it, because __unicode__ must\n            # return a unicode object.\n            u = unicode(u)\n        return u\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        s = self._format()\n        if isinstance(s, unicode):\n            s = s.encode('utf8')\n        else:\n            # __str__ must return a str.\n            s = str(s)\n        return s\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '%s(%s)' % (self.__class__.__name__, str(self))\n\n    def _get_format_string(self):\n        \"\"\"Return format string for this exception or None\"\"\"\n        fmt = getattr(self, '_fmt', None)\n        if fmt is not None:\n            from bzrlib.i18n import gettext\n            return gettext(unicode(fmt)) # _fmt strings should be ascii\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        if self.__class__ is not other.__class__:\n            return NotImplemented\n        return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__\n# Unit test for method __unicode__ of class IllegalUseOfScopeReplacer\ndef test_IllegalUseOfScopeReplacer___unicode__():"}], "max_tokens": 200, "temperature": 0.0, "stop": ["\n# Unit test for", "\ndef ", "\nclass "]}
