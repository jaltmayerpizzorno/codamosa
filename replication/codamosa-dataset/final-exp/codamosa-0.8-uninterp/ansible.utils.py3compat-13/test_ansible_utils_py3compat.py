Using the functions in this module corrects\ndeficiencies in the urllib2 module wherever possible.\n\nThere are also third-party libraries (for instance, requests) which can be used\nto replace urllib2 with a more secure library. However, all third party libraries\nrequire that the library be installed on the managed machine. That is an extra step\nfor users making use of a module. If possible, avoid third party libraries by using\nthis code instead.\n'
